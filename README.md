> Originally created by Stephanie Eckles ([@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)), and modified for use in Hacking History by Matt Price.

## Quick Start

1. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/HackingHistory/hh-project-11ty-starter-kit)
to your **personal** account.

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies. Then run `npm start`
to start a server which will (mostly) auto-update as you work.
Use `npm run build` to run a "production" version, which will also generate
social share preview images.

1. Open `src/_data/meta.js`, and update the metadata for the site

1. start editing the markdown to create your site.

1. Review the [styling documentation](https://5t3ph.github.io/html-sass-jumpstart/)
for the included minimal Sass framework, particularly the theme variables,
to quickly customize the starter.

1. Edit `src/index.njk` to change the home page - including changing the template type if desired - and then create content within `_pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.

1. Check out the [About page](/about/) for expanded details on included features of this starter.

1. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.

It's not required, but highly recommended, and is also how the build process is setup to run
against. -->
