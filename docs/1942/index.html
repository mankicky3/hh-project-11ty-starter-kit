<p>The failure of the German Army to take Moscow by the end of 1941 would start the slow downfall of Germany. Some campaigns during this year managed to push back against the Red Army and seize even more territory such as in the Caucuses, but this inability to seize the capital of the USSR combined with ongoing logistical issues stretched the Germans to their breaking point. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese and the subsequent declaration of war on America by Germany at the end of 1941 also had massive implications on the Eastern Front despite the inability of the Allies to directly assist the Soviets militarily.</p>
<p>1942 would be a major year on the Eastern Front, as both sides attempted to stabilize the gains they had achieved and attempt to push back against the opposing side. The Winter Offensive continued from the previous year for the Soviets, while Hitler attempted to find other fronts to press his advantage and secure other objectives instead of Moscow. The ultimate display of brutality and the most significant battle of the year would take place in Stalingrad, leading to the bloodiest battle of the war and a testament to the scale and brutality of the conflict.</p>
<h3 id="the-winter-offensive" tabindex="-1">The Winter Offensive<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#the-winter-offensive" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>The start of the Winter Offensive took place in December of 1941 and would continue well into 1942. This period marked the furthest the German Army would advance towards Moscow before being pushed back by Zhukov and his counterattack. Coordinating with the rest of the <em>Stavka</em>, the Soviet high command, Zhukov was able to redeploy 18 divisions and 1700 tanks from Siberia to reinforce his counterattack (Baker, 54). These troops were able to be redeployed due to Japan shifting its focus south rather than assisting in an attack on the USSR due to American economic pressure, forcing the Japanese to strike at Indochina to secure resources like oil and rubber (Ellman, 186). The USSR learned of this decision to go south through Richard Sorge, a spy based in Japan, and allowed the USSR to weaken their Western flank in order to prevent a German victory, significantly swinging the tide of battle.</p>
<p>Initially, the Red Army was successful in pushing back the Germans, but Zhukov would become frustrated at the slow progress and the time given for counter maneuvers. On December 9th he issued an order that forced commanders to penetrate enemy formations instead of simply engaging screening forces, helping to lead to possible encirclements appearing over the next few days (Glantz, 214). This advance would continue until 1942 when the Red Army would itself go on the offensive. January 7th saw Stalin issue a general offensive across the front, with the goal of stretching out the German Army which now had to contend with Lend Lease support from the US (Baker, 55). This focus on attrition was crucial, as the <em>blitzkrieg</em> had relied upon quick victories through its use of mechanized warfare. With resources dwindling, the offensive could not be sustained and the larger size of the USSR could be utilized. Manpower was also an issue, as by the end of 1941 the Germans were losing around 3,000 men a day, a casualty rate that could not be sustained for any length of time (Baker, 56). By March 31st the German advance had been stalled across the front and the Red Army had regained control over conquered parts of the USSR.</p>

<p>The offensive that started in January had forced the Germans to retreat back from the east, but the spring would give them a chance to go on the offensive themselves once again. Rather than focus on the north or central Russia, Hitler's focus would be on the south towards the Caucasus region of the USSR. Codenamed <em>Fall Blau</em> (Operation Blue), this decision to invade the south hinged on several key factors, notably the economic situation of Germany. The success of the Japanese in the Far East and Erwin Rommel in North Africa gave Hitler the idea that he could link up to these forces through the Middle East and assault the USSR with a combined front, focusing their efforts on knocking out the nation (Overy, 157). Economically the issues with <em>blitzkrieg</em> begin to emerge, with the Caucus region being one of the most important oil fields in the USSR. So vital was capturing the petroleum industry that Hitler stated that &quot;If I don't get the oil of Maikop and Grozny (Two cities in the region), then I Must end the war&quot; (Shepherd, 243). Strategically the choice to focus on the south also allowed Hitler to regain the initiative, surprising the Soviets with a sudden attack. The USSR was prepared for more fighting outside of Moscow given its political importance and its role as the center of communication for the army, a belief that did make sense (Baker, 57). Ultimately Hitler did not follow this line of action, committing himself in a different direction.</p>
<p>The initial assault by the Germans was a success, catching the overextended Soviet forces by surprise and taking advantage of the Red Army's failure to stop the offensive. June 28th saw the start of this plan take place and by July 23rd Rostov-on-Don had been captured by the German Army (Overy, 158). This initial success was devasting for the Soviets, both strategically and for the morale of the public, but due to Hitler's direct intervention in the planning the seeds of a Soviet victory were planted. The goal of the operation was two-fold: capture the oil fields of the Caucus and take Stalingrad, with both objectives having an army group attached to accomplish this. Rather than allowing Group A to seize the oil fields first, Hitler split his two groups and attempted to take both Stalingrad and the Caucus at the same time (Baker, 63). Initial success for the Germans occurred, but the push south did not go as fast as Hitler would have wanted while at the same time forcing Moscow to react due to the strategic importance of the region. It was during this period that Stalin's famous Order 227 was delivered, calling for &quot;Not one step back!&quot; and preventing panic retreats among divisions through the use of blocking divisions that would fire upon &quot;cowards and traitors&quot; (Order 227). As the German Army continued to advance, it would stall on August 28th, failing to reach its goal of taking Grozny and showcasing the failure of the operation to the German high command (Baker, 64).</p>
<h3 id="stalingrad-hell-on-earth" tabindex="-1">Stalingrad: Hell on Earth<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#stalingrad-hell-on-earth" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>The Battle of Stalingrad would begin on August 23rd and last until the following year, ending on February 2nd, 1943. These five months would see some of the most brutal fighting in the European theater, a vignette of the brutality across the front. The Soviet Union was prepared for a battle to take place in the city, with huge reserves being prepared around the northern and southern parts of Stalingrad, and several operation plans were drawn up to encircle and destroy German armies in the region (Baker, 65).</p>
<p>Red Army tactics in the city were also changed by the commanding general, Vasili Chuikov, to reflect the reality of urban conflict. Losing Stalingrad was not an option, so rather than focus on larger, strategic goals, Chuikov instead dedicated time to tactics that would make the German advance halt and wither away (Overy, 174). Some of these tactics included &quot;hugging&quot; German infantry positions with his own forces, placing them at risk due to their closeness but also preventing effective usage of German artillery and air support over fears of friendly fire (Shepherd, 258). Night attacks were also common, as Soviet troops snuck behind enemy lines to attack isolated German units, and snipers kept overwatch over the streets through all hours of the day (Overy, 175). German units were unable to rest, being forced to lie awake in fear of an attack, sapping both their energy and morale. Smart urban combat was utilized as well, focusing on securing key buildings rather than holding everything in sight, instead of dedicating time to preparing traps and firing fields for troops within (Shepherd, 258). This allowed the Red Army to concentrate its efforts on smaller goals that would give them the defensive advantage against advancing German troops.</p>
<p>Stalingrad's fame would be bolstered by the actions that took place in November, as the Red Army began to push back against the German advance yet again. Operation Uranus was the codename for an attack that took place between November 19th and 23rd, leading to the encirclement of Axis forces around Stalingrad, notably the German Sixth Army. This led to 330,000 German soldiers trapped within the city, as they were forced to defend themselves from all sides (Baker, 65). Attempts were made by the Germans to break through from within and attempt to rescue soldiers from outside, but none would succeed. Compounding this was Hitler's order that refused to allow troops within to retreat from the city, forcing them to fight to the death or their eventual capture (Baker, 67). Ultimately 300,000 German soldiers would be captured or killed by February 2nd, with a further 655,000 coming from allied armies (Shepherd, 271). This victory was won at great cost by the Soviets, however, as significant resources had to be poured into securing the city, and fighting across the front continued as well. By the end of 1942, Soviet casualties were over 11 million, but they had stopped <em>Fall Blau</em> and the southern push.</p>
