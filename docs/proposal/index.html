<p>This project will focus on the Eastern Front during World War II, also known as the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot; by the Russian-speaking world due to their late entry against Germany. This was the bloodiest front of the bloodiest conflict in history, seeing tens of millions of soldiers and civilians die due to combat and other external factors like famine or sickness.</p>
<p>Besides being a massive front in terms of manpower, the size of the Eastern Front is hard to grasp. At around 1000 miles stretching from the Baltic Sea all the way down to the Caucuses, the sheer scale of this front is just as difficult to conceptualize. The size of the front played several key roles during the war, giving the Soviet Union enough space to retreat back to Moscow and slow down the Germans, with the invaders having to stretch out already thing logistical supply lines. Understanding how big the front was is therefore an important part of just learning about World War II.</p>
<p>The reason mapping has been chosen is to give a visual representation, as names and dates can blend together while seeing something on a map is easier to understand intuitively, In addition, sometimes people just don't know where certain places are located. They might lack knowledge about the region someone closer to the area already possesses, or even worse incorrectly place the location. Maps help resolve this issue and are a good medium to showcase this topic.</p>
<h1 id="audience" tabindex="-1">Audience<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#audience" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>The audience of this website can be generally placed as anyone with a passing interest in history, as the goal is to teach people about the scale of the front rather than going into complex military maneuvers or debate tank armor slopes. What little historical context a person needs to understand the topic should be provided in the website itself, but the more a person knows, the better they can understand the information being presented.</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is the broadest audience possible, but should that not be feasible then at least people who have prior knowledge about what the Eastern Front was, even if the specifics are lacking. An average user should be able to access the site, without knowing many cities in Eastern Europe, and come out with a general idea of the state of the Eastern Front at various points in time.</p>
<h1 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#structure" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>This website can be divided into two separate sections: a longer essay form for information, and the maps themselves. An essay will be provided for each major change in the front such as the start, the furthest extent the Germans pushed, and the furthest the Soviets pushed as well. Should there be more time more snapshots can be included, but those are the big three that need to be there. The essays will include information about general force dispositions and important events that have taken place or will soon take place, such as major battles or political events.</p>
<p>The maps themselves will use the Google Maps API from last year as the base layer with GeoJSON being used to create different shapes on top of the maps themselves. The reason I want to use the Google Maps API is because of prior experience, but also because it has modern-day borders already set up. While historical borders might also be an option, the goal is to visualize how far the front had gone, and I feel that this will be easier with modern-day borders to give context. Important battle locations and other events will also be marked on the map.</p>
