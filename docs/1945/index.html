<p>By 1945, any hope of a German victory was out of the question with both the Western and Eastern Fronts rapidly collapsing. Following Germany's failed offensive into the Ardennes it was a question of who would take Berlin rather than if it would fall, with both the West and Soviets wanting to be the side that claimed the German capital. Stalin desired the city and felt that it should be his prize given the sacrifice of the Red Army and Soviet citizens over the past four years (Overy, 255). The city itself was also important symbolically given its status as capital, and the side that claimed it would be seen as the power that defeated Germany. This was such an important factor in Stalin's mind that he reclaimed control of the campaign in November of 1944, relegating the Stavka to control over the front (Overy, 255). Not only was the capture of Berlin to be a Soviet victory, but now it would be Stalin's personal triumph over the German menace.</p>
<p>The German offensive in the West forced them to move resources that could have been used to defend the East. While there was no realistic way for the Germans to hold out, it exacerbated issues and allowed the Red Army to advance at an even faster pace. To understand how little the German Army was working with, its airforce (Or lack thereof) serves as the best example of how desperate the Germans were. To combat the 10,500 Soviet aircraft, Germany had only had 300 at its disposal, and yet despite this Hitler order his generals to hold (Shepherd, 499). This order to hold would cause many unnecessary deaths and deprive Germany of the ability to create a cohesive defensive force.</p>

<p>The disparity between the German and Soviet forces allowed the Red Army to advance rapidly, breaking through defensive lines and engaging in deep battle. For the first time in over a century the Russian Army was outside of its borders and winning, and Stalin was keen on not repeating the mistakes of World War I and the Polish-Soviet War. Staggered attacks were utilized by the army to confuse the Germans, with a three-pronged offensive beginning on every day between January 12-14 (Shepherd, 499). The Red Army was able to advance deeper into Poland, capturing Warsaw on January 15th following the failed uprising in the city, and in the following three weeks advancing over 300 kilometers (Baker, 99). During this period Hitler had sacked multiple Field Marshalls and commanders for their failure to hold off the Soviets or their requests to retreat and consolidate. The situation was so desperate that Hitler appointed Henrich Himmler, head of the SS, to command an army group. His military knowledge was non-existent and a colonel serving under him recalled that during a presentation it felt as though he was listening to a &quot;blind man describing colors&quot; (Shepherd, 500).</p>
<p>Further advances were made into occupied Polish territory by the Soviets, and despite their position on the Oder River, the decision was made to not immediately advance on Berlin. Instead, the focus would be on the last pocket of resistance and industrial sectors in Silesia and Prussia, as Stalin recognized that such a direct assault would be costly (Overy, 262-263). The Silesian industrial heartland was captured, an important sector for Germany, and Pomerania would also fall in mid-March as the front was stabilized (Shepherd, 500-501). This pause brought with it the establishment of the largest single force ever assembled in wartime. Over 2 million men, 6,250 tanks, 7,500 aircraft, and 41,600 heavy guns and mortars were lined up in the East, a force that was larger than the one Germany fielded for Barbarossa (Baker, 100). The push into Germany would come from a bridgehead on the Oder, and by April Berlin was encircled by the Red Army.</p>
<h2 id="the-battle-of-berlin" tabindex="-1">The Battle of Berlin<a class="tdbc-anchor" href="#the-battle-of-berlin" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>The assault on Berlin began on April 16th with one of the largest artillery barrages in history, mirroring previous Soviet engagements across the Eastern Front. By now the German commanders were aware of this tactic and able to prevent casualties by pulling their men out of the first trenches, forcing the Soviets to hammer their way into the city (Baker, 100).  This bombardment had actually slowed the advance due to the damage caused to the ground and the amount of dust kicked up by the shells, causing the searchlights used to blind the Red Army soldiers (Shepherd, 511). The initial attacks were sluggish, with Red Army forces only arriving at the suburbs of Berlin on April 20th. Simultaneously another front into Berlin was opened in the south, suffering none o the issues the initial engagement had dealt with and nearing Berlin by April 18th (Overy, 271). A race had developed between the two fronts as both attempted to secure Berlin and encircle it to prevent any German attempts at a breakout. April 25th had the two fronts join together and secure the city, with American forces encountering the Soviets that same day (Shepherd, 512).</p>
<p>Hitler would commit suicide on May 1st, with Berlin surrendering the following day. The surrender of Germany itself would occur on May 8th, and May 9th for the Soviets as that was the time in Moscow the declaration was signed. The army that had terrified the world and defeated France in only a few weeks had been crushed followings its failure to defeat the Soviet Union. Victory would come at a cost, however, with anywhere from 8-10 million Red Army soldiers being killed, and millions of more civilians caught in the crossfire (Overy, 288). There is no doubt that the Soviet Union suffered, if not the most, one of the worst experiences during the Second World War. Both sides suffered unimaginable losses across one of the largest fronts in Europe, and conceptualizing this remains difficult today.
