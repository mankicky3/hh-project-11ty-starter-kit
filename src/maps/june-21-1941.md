The invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany occured on June 21st, 1941, breaking the promised neutrality pact signed just two years ago. Whether either side truly beleived in the legitimacy of the treaty given their ideological differences is debatably, but the invasion initially stunned Stalin, who would not publically address the nation until July 3rd, 11 days later. On the front, the initial attacks destroyed the command of the Red Army due to the nature of the invasion, forcing commanders to look back to Moscow for orders. The orders that did arrive were not aware of the scale of the invasion and the conditions of the front, but were passed along anyway.
