## Germany on the Defensive

1943 on the Eastern Front is not often discussed when studying World War II as a whole, being overshadowed by events in North Africa and Italy with US intervention in those regions. With the exception of the Battle of Kursk, no major engagements reached the scale of previous battles that occurred on the front. Despite this, this period was vital in ensuring that Germany would never be able to retake the East, forcing them on the defensive until the Red Army would arrive at the gates of Berlin and fly the hammer and sickle over the Reichstag.

The image of the German Army as an unstoppable force that had been able to accomplish unimaginable feats had been smashed following Stalingrad, as news of the failure spread throughout Germany. The same military that had defeated France in six weeks, succeeding where Imperial Germany had failed, was now demoralized with one officer reporting that "I understand nothing anymore. Stalingrad is madness. (Shepherd, 318). The Soviets on the other hand had turned the battle into a legend, showcasing the might of the Red Army standing up against the fascist invaders. To have been present at the battle and survive became a status symbol, and trains moving soldiers once filled with trepidation and fear turned to hope and resistance (Overy, 186). While not the most significant battle of the war, it restored morale to the Soviets and gave them the ability to start their advances in 1944.

### The Battle of Kursk

While Stalingrad may have been a significant moral victory for the Soviets, the Battle of Kursk would mark the turning point of the Eastern Front. Following the failure of the German offensive, Germany would never again mount any large-scale strategic attacks on the Eastern Front, as pressure from the West forced them to divert resources to protect Italy. Kursk would also become known as the largest tank battle in history due to the sheer amount of men and equipment committed to the operation from both sides.

Hitler and his generals understood that they had to strike against the Soviets while their industry was not yet fully recovered following the destruction caused by the last two years. Already in 1943, the USSR was producing 24,000 tanks and 48,000 heavy guns compared to Germany's 17,000 and 27,000 respectively (Shepherd, 328-329). Operation Citadel, the overall plan that included the Battle of Kursk, can be viewed as a defensive plan, with the goal being to crush a large number of Soviet forces and allow Germany time to recuperate from its losses. The goal of the plan was to encircle the Kursk salient, a protruding area in the German lines by the Red Army, originally being planned for May 3rd (Baker, 73). However, the operation was postponed multiple times due to unfavorable weather conditions, giving the Soviets time to respond.

Red Army command was well aware of the appeal that a salient had for the German Army, being a strategically important area to secure. Defensive preparations were made across the front and special attention was paid to Kursk during the four-month lull in fighting on the front. Within the bulge, seven armies were crammed in order to fortify the region and prepare for a potential counterattack. By the start of the battle, over 1.3 million men, 3,444 tanks, 2.900 aircraft, and 19,000 heavy guns were located in the salient on the Soviet side, amounting to 40% of its manpower and 75% of its armored units (Overy, 201). The Germans meanwhile had 900,000 soldiers, 2,700 tanks, 2,000 aircraft, and over 10,000 guns (Overy, 201).

The battle began on Jul 5th with the Germans advancing into the well-prepared Soviet position. Assaults came from the north and south in an attempt to close off the salient, but German troops could not even penetrate the front lines of the Soviet army. Fighting would escalate and reach its peak on July 12th with the massive armored clash at Pokhorovka, and the following day the operation would be canceled by Hitler (Shepherd, 332). Despite the cancellation of Citadel, the Germans were able to achieve some success in terms of material losses against the Soviets. Losing only 1,100 tanks on the German side was somewhat problematic but given both tank production being scaled up and inflicting more losses on the Soviet side, some success was found (Shepherd, 332). The Germans however did fail in their goal of stopping the Soviet advance, not being able to find time to recover. On the Soviet side, the casualties were much lower than what was seen at Stalingrad and other previous battles. 470,000 soldiers were killed in 1942, but Kursk saw only 70,000 casualties across all branches of the Soviet military, and a further 183,000 were lost breaking the German line (Overy, 212). While lower than previous battles, this number is still nearly as many soldiers lost for Britain or the US across the entire war, while the USSR suffered this in only two months.

### Advancing West

Following the Battle of Kursk, the Soviet Union would continue its advance and reclaim territory it once held from German control. While no event occurred during the Fall and Winter periods that can be considered as significant as Kursk, the offensives that followed the battle helped secure future Red Army success as the German Army was stretched to its limit with new developments in Greece and Italy. In response to the changing nature of the war, Hitler instituted what was known as the "Fortress Europe" policy, with several "walls" being created to protect Germany from further attacks such as the Atlantic Wall or more relevantly the Eastern Wall (*Ostwall*) (Shepherd, 357). Positions were taken up at strategically useful locations that could be used to defend against any further Red Army advances, one of these being the Dnieper River. Ukraine would be contested during the fall of 1944, both due to the region's importance and status as the "breadbasket of Europe", but also due to the momentum the Red Army had following Kursk.

The German formations on the Dnieper were part of a larger series of defenses stretching all the way to Finland, with this particular section being known as the "Wotan Line." Army Group Center and South were given permission by Hitler to retreat back to this position in order to avoid encirclement and recover across the river, but the Red Army continued to advance. The river itself was an important barrier, with some banks on the east rising up 100 feet and the river itself being 1000 yards wide at some points (Baker, 83). The importance of this river was known to all, and plans were made to get around such a massive roadblock. A combination of the German Army being unable to prepare in time and the use of airborne troops would see the advance continue in the south. The "Wotan Line" had been declared but never properly reinforced and the one advantage this position held was forcing the Red Army to cross a river (Baker, 83). A massive airborne assault was utilized by the Soviets on 23-26 September in order to divert resources away from the line, and despite difficulties was able to allow other elements of the Red Army to succeed in this task a month later. November 3rd saw the Dnieper breached by Soviet forces, and Kyiv fell 3 days later (Baker, 84). The Southern Front was now firmly in control of the Soviets, and further preparations were being made.

Despite this success, other parts of the front were somewhat stabilized by the German Army. Army Group North and Center were able to hold out against the onslaught, and forces retreating from the south were able to create new lines that would hold until the following year (Shepherd, 370). However, this did tie up German resources and wear down the army, constantly overstretching the military and allowing other fronts to open up like in Italy.
