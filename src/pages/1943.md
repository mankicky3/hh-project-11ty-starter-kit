## Germany on the Defensive

1943 on the Eastern Front is not often discussed when studying World War II as a whole, being overshadowed by events in North Africa and Italy with US intervention in those regions. With the exception of the Battle of Kursk, no major engagements reached the scale of previous battles that occurred on the front. Despite this, this period was vital in ensuring that Germany would never be able to retake the East, forcing them on the defensive until the Red Army would arrive at the gates of Berlin and fly the hammer and sickle over the Reichstag.

The image of the German Army as an unstoppable force that had been able to accomplish unimaginable feats had been smashed following Stalingrad, as news of the failure spread throughout Germany. The same military that had defeated France in six weeks, succeeding where Imperial Germany had failed, was now demoralized with one officer reporting that "I understand nothing anymore. Stalingrad is madness. (Shepherd, 318). The Soviets on the other hand had turned the battle into a legend, showcasing the might of the Red Army standing up against the fascist invaders. To have been present at the battle and survive became a status symbol, and trains moving soldiers once filled with trepidation and fear turned to hope and resistance (Overy, 186). While not the most significant battle of the war, it restored morale to the Soviets and gave them the ability to start their advances in 1934.
