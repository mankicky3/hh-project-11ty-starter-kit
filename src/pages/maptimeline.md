###  The Scale of the Eastern Front

Otherwise known as the Great Patriotic War by the Soviets, the Eastern Front of World War II Would see around 30 million deaths occur, both civilian and military. Some of the bloodies battles of the war took place in this region over a thousand miles apart from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Germany's decision to invade the USSR and the resulting destruction has been atributed a one of the primary, if not the primary cause, of Germany's eventual defeat. Having to maintain both attempting to bomb Britain out of the war and fighting a war on a different front the same size as New York City to Orlando stretched German resources to the brink.
