## The German Army on the Defensive

By 1944 the Red Army and the Soviet Union had come online and were significantly more prepared to fight materially and in terms of morale. Materially, the 3.1 million Axis soldiers supported by 3,000 aircraft and 2,3000 tanks were not in a position to face off against the 6.4 million Red Army soldiers, the 13,400 planes covering them, and the 5,800 tanks leading them (Overy, 236). The majority of Axis forces were sent to the Eastern Front, and even then the disparity in numbers is staggering. 1944 also saw the Allies embark on D-Day, further reducing the resources available to be sent to the East and exacerbating the situation. Morale among the Red Army was also at an all-time high, no longer on the defensive against the veterans of the German Army they faced in 1941. 

Limited action would take place during the spring of 1944 due to weather issues, a common theme on the Eastern Front given the importance of mechanized warfare. With the exception of the Liberation of Leningrad, large-scale campaigns could not take place with the mud caused by spring thaws and the rain that followed, forcing both sides to wait out the weather or risk attacks in less than ideal conditions.
