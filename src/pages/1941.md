## The Nazis Invade The Soviet Union

The invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany occurred on June 21st, 1941, breaking the promised neutrality pact signed just two years ago. Whether either side truly believed in the legitimacy of the treaty given their ideological differences is debatably, but the invasion initially stunned Stalin, who would not publically address the nation until July 3rd, 11 days later. While it is a common belief that the invasion caught Stalin completely off guard, he did understand that Hitler would turn East at some point following their non-aggression pact (Shepard, 135). The issue was over how early the attack took place and the position it put Germany in, repeating the mistakes of the First World War with Germany forced into two fronts.  On the battlefield, the initial attacks destroyed the command of the Red Army due to the nature of the invasion, forcing commanders to look back to Moscow for orders. The orders that did arrive were not aware of the scale of the invasion and the conditions of the front but were passed along anyway.

### The Germans Advance

Strategically the doctrine the Red Army was working with failed to take advantage of the space they were given, with Stalin ultimately controlling how the army would function in a climate of fear and terror. Rather than utilizing the vast amount of land in the west to consolidate the army, Stalin instead wanted the entire front to be defended, a much more difficult prospect than retreating to a better defensible position (Sheppard, 135). Part of the reason why the doctrine was underdeveloped and so tightly controlled by Stalin was because of the dictator's own actions during the late 30s, in what is known as the Great Purge. Stalin's paranoia had reached a level not seen before, and fears of traitors in the military and Communist Party manifested in a purge of the armed forces, leading to some of the best commanders either being forced to resign or executed in show trials (Bergström, 11). Soviet forces could almost certainly have held out better than they did given enough warning and the authority to retreat from the front, but Stalin's insistence on defending the whole front prevented this from occurring. Even basic mobilization was prevented, allowing German planes to destroy 1,200 Soviet aircraft that were lined up outside their airbases within hours of the war starting (Overy, 76). The Germans had the advantage of both strategic surprise and tactical surprise, allowing them to advance rapidly towards Moscow.

German doctrine had been adapted to taking down the USSR following the Invasion of France, further surprising the Red Army. Rather than the smaller engagements followed by a clash between the two armies taking place, the German Army advanced all at once and overwhelmed the defenders, giving them the momentum needed to push forward (Overy, 76). This was consistent with the German utilization of *blitzkrieg*, lighting war, which utilized quick pushes supported by air power to quickly encircle their opponents. The German Air Force was so successful in this endeavor that initial flights over the USSR were not met by anti-air defenses or enemy planes, allowing them to reach the massive kill count mentioned earlier (Bergström, 14). The ground war was no different, as the three main Army Groups: North, Center, and South, began their advance East, quickly leading to massive encirclements. One of the first of these pockets was the Minsk Pocket which ended on July 8th following its destruction by Army Group Center. The pocket, which could have possibly gone so far as Smolensk had Hitler not ordered the army to slow down, ended up with 324,000 Red Army troops captured (Sheppard, 137). For comparison, this was double the amount of casualties (Wounded and killed) that Germany suffered from the Invasion of France. This would be the first in a series of pockets across the front as the German Army continued to advance East.

### The Red Army Holds?

The initial few months of the war looked like Germany would crush the Soviet Union, as the Red Army failed to mount any real defense until later in the year. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to point out that the invasion was a mistake and that Hitler had doomed himself by attacking the USSR. The reality is more complicated, as several factors influenced this decision and made it reasonable in Hitler's eyes to invade. One critical reason was the issue of resources, as fueling the German war machine required massive imports of vital materials such as oil from other nations. The naval blockade of Germany instituted by Great Britain meant that Germany was forced to rely on the USSR for these resources, paying for these purchases with machine tools and military equipment (Ellman, 80). Following the division of Poland, Red Army troops had to be redeployed to the annexed nation, abandoning their fortifications deeper with the USSR, moving them out of position. The Red Army itself was undergoing massive reforms after the disappointing performance that took place during the Winter War against Finland, and German observers understood that should these reforms pass that the Red Army would become a formidable opponent should they invade (Ellman, 79). Striking at the USSR now would maximize Germany's chances of victory, as the Red Army embarrassed itself on the world stage against Finland and helped lead Hitler to the conclusion that the Red Army was weak (Ellman, 88-89).

While the invasion may have been a success in the initial months, it did not come without a serious cost to the German Army. Most German commanders understood that the Eastern Front had damaged the army, suffering 686,000 casualties by November (20% of the original force and every replacement since June 22), and required a large commitment of forces to continue with 2.7 million men being fielded (Glantz, 181O). Logistically the Germans were overstretched as their rapid advance had to wait for supplies such as fuel to continue their attack, giving the Soviets time to regroup. If Germany wished to win its fight against the USSR, it would have to do it by the time winter started. The advance on Moscow began in earnest on November 15th, with a force of around 233,000 in the main army with a further 240,000 supporting from the north (Glantz, 189O). German troops would continue to advance, at great cost, towards Moscow, but the Red Army had begun to organize more efficiently and mount a defense of the city. Other fronts also began to appear more favorable for the Soviets as the weather helped slow down the advancing Germans. By December 4th the Red Army had prevented the capture of Leningrad and Rostov, along with keeping the Germans from the Caucus region. The German Army was halted on the outskirts of Moscow, and whether the Germans could win became a genuine question. These actions came at the cost of millions of Soviet soldiers, as the war reached a level of brutality not seen on the Western Front. 2.8 million Soviet soldiers would be lost in the first three months, and another 2 million as well by December 31st, virtually wiping out the peacetime reserve of the Red Army (Glantz, 201O).
